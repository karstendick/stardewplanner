# Some stuff that community has asked but are not yet implemented
- Count for different stuff placed (how many sprinkers, roads etc)
- Image export
- More trees, tappers.
- Depth rendering so buildings etc could be fully drawn out
- Save exporting
- Better highlights
- Also would be cool to have list of done plans
